## Find Bugs Workflow

You are auditing the current project's codebase for bugs and other issues. The user may have
provided focus areas or constraints via `$ARGUMENTS`. Your job is to find real issues and add them
to the project's `PLAN.md` as future work items.

### Step 1: Read PLAN.md

Read `PLAN.md` at the project root (if it exists) so you can pass its contents to the sub-agents as
context. This helps them avoid reporting issues that are already tracked.

### Step 2: Launch the discovery sub-agent

Launch a sub-agent (subagent_type: "general-purpose") with the following instructions:

> Read through the codebase methodically. Your goal is to identify real issues — bugs,
> inconsistencies, correctness problems, security concerns, performance pitfalls, data integrity
> risks, operational hazards, or sources of confusion that could cause problems downstream.
>
> **Scope:** If the user provided arguments, treat them as guidance on where to focus or what kinds
> of issues to prioritize. The arguments were: `$ARGUMENTS`
> If no arguments were provided, audit the full codebase with no particular bias.
>
> **Approach:**
> 1. Read source files, tests, configs, and documentation broadly before forming conclusions.
> 2. Do not assume bugs exist. Do not assume the code is bug-free. Simply read and evaluate.
> 3. For each issue found, provide:
>    - A short title
>    - The file(s) and line(s) involved
>    - A clear explanation of what is wrong and why it matters
>    - Severity: low, medium, or high
>    - Category: one of correctness, security, performance, data-integrity, consistency,
>      operational, or clarity
> 4. Do not report stylistic preferences, missing documentation, or hypothetical issues that
>    require unlikely preconditions. Focus on things that could actually cause harm or confusion.
>
> **Context — already-tracked work:**
> (Paste the contents of PLAN.md here, or "No PLAN.md exists." if it doesn't.)
>
> Return your findings as a numbered list. If you found nothing, say so.

### Step 3: Launch the review sub-agent

Take the discovery sub-agent's output and pass it to a second sub-agent (subagent_type:
"general-purpose") for review. This agent's job is to filter out false positives.

> You are reviewing a list of potential bugs and issues found by another agent. Your job is to
> verify each finding and filter out anything that is not a genuine concern.
>
> For each reported issue:
> 1. Read the relevant source code yourself. Do not trust the first agent's characterization
>    blindly.
> 2. Determine whether the issue is real. Ask yourself: could this actually cause incorrect
>    behavior, confusion, security exposure, data corruption, performance degradation, or
>    operational problems? Or is it benign in practice?
> 3. Mark each issue as **keep** or **drop**, with a one-sentence justification.
>
> **Keep** issues that involve: correctness bugs, security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks,
> performance problems, operational hazards, meaningful inconsistencies, or genuine sources of
> confusion.
>
> **Drop** issues that are: stylistic nitpicks, hypothetical problems requiring implausible
> preconditions, already handled elsewhere in the code, or genuinely never going to be problematic.
>
> Return the filtered list — only the kept issues — using the same format as the input (numbered
> list with title, files, explanation, severity, and category). If nothing survives the filter,
> say so.

### Step 4: Update PLAN.md

Read `PLAN.md` again (it may have changed). For each surviving issue from the review sub-agent,
add it as a bullet under the "Next up" section. Use this format for each entry:

```
- **[category/severity] Title** — Explanation. (file:line)
```

If `PLAN.md` doesn't exist, create it with a top-level "Next Up" section then add the items under
"Next Up.

If no issues survived the review, tell the user that no actionable issues were found and do not
modify `PLAN.md`.

### Step 5: Report

Tell the user:
- How many issues were found initially vs. how many survived review.
- A brief summary of what was found (or that nothing was found).
- Any patterns or themes worth noting.

Then stop and yield to the user.
